# SparseExplanationValues

The introduction of SEV has provided an sparse explanation for each unit based on a binary machine learning classifier and new ways to increase this sparsity explanation without its performance (like Accuracy and AUC). This code is used for **AISTATS 2024**, which contains implementations and Experiments for *Sparse Explanations Values (SEV)* and two optimal methods: *All-Opt* and *Vol-Opt*. 

# Development

Guidelines for developers who wants to reproduce the experiments results, modify and test the code.

## Repository Structure

- **SEV**: The implementation of the definition of Sparse Explanations and two optimization methods.
- **Data**: The data used for experiments parts
- **Plots**: The code for plotting and figures in appendix
- **Experiments**: The code for different experiments
